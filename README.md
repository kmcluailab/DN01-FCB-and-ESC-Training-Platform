Scientech DN01 – FCB and ESC Training Platform
The Scientech DN01 is an advanced, modular training platform designed to provide hands-on experience in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) electronics and control systems. Ideal for students, researchers, and educators, this platform enables users to explore and understand the fundamental components and functionalities of modern drone systems.

At the core of DN01 is a powerful Flight Controller Board (FCB), built around the STM32F405 ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller running at 168 MHz. The board supports open-source firmware such as ArduPilot and PX4, offering interfaces like UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, and USB. With a compact 36mm x 36mm size and onboard 16MB flash memory, it ensures seamless integration and flexibility for UAV development.

The system includes Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs) capable of delivering 30A continuous current, running on BLHeli_32 firmware, and operating within 7.4V–14.8V. Paired with 2212-920KV brushless motors, they provide up to 1200g of thrust, supporting 9–10 inch propellers with precision control through adjustable PWM frequencies (10–490Hz).

The DN01 also integrates critical sensors such as IMU (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer), GPS, and a Barometer for altitude and positional awareness. It features robust RC signal monitoring, voltage checks, and calibration tools to ensure system reliability and safety before flight.

Comprehensive training modules guide users through pre-flight checks, ESC calibration, PID tuning, signal analysis, sensor data logging, and mission planning. The platform supports multiple flight modes including Stabilize, AltHold, Loiter, and Auto, enabling real-world experimentation in autonomous navigation and control.

Software integration with Mission Planner offers GUI-based configuration, telemetry logging, and real-time data visualization, enriching the learning process. The DN01 also supports custom parameter tuning and control logic development.

Whether for academic labs, technical training, or personal research, the Scientech DN01 delivers a complete, practical learning environment for mastering UAV technologies.
